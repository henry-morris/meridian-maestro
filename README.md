# From Fumbling to Flawless: Automating Meridian DSP5000 Speakers with HomeKit and Raspberry Pi

## The Sound of Perfection: Why I Love My Meridian DSP5000s

I love my Meridian DSP5000 speakers: they sound great and are all-digital.

## The Daily Dilemma: A Symphony of Frustration

But I didn't love the process of turning them onâ€¦ every time I wanted to listen to music, I had to go through the same tedious routine:

1. Activate the power plugs
2. Find the remote control
3. Turn on the speakers
4. Click-click-click my way up to the right volume

## The Lightbulb Moment: Bridging High-End Audio with Smart Home Tech

It felt like I was stuck in the past while the rest of my home was getting smarter. I knew there had to be a better way. I wanted the simplicity of smart home control for my high-end audio system. Imagine just tapping a button on my phone and having the speakers power up, set themselves to the perfect volume, and be ready to play in seconds.

## Your Roadmap to Audio Nirvana: What This Post Offers

In this post, I'm going to share how I turned that vision into reality. I'll walk you through my journey of automating my Meridian DSP5000 speakers using RS232, a Raspberry Pi, a bit of coding magic and HomeKit. Hopefully it'll be helpful to fellow Meridian DSP5000 owners who want the simplicity of one-click music!

## The Dream Setup: One Tap to Audio Bliss

My aim was straightforward but game-changing: I wanted my Meridian DSP5000 speakers to turn on and automatically set themselves to 90% volume within seconds of me activating them through HomeKit. No more remotes, no more manual volume adjusting - just instant, perfect sound at the tap of a button.

## The Cast of Characters: Meet the Tech Behind the Magic

Here's what I used:

1. Two Meridian DSP5000 speakers
2. Two Meross WiFi Smart Plugs (HomeKit compatible)
3. Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 with a fast MicroSD card
4. USB to Serial RS232 Adapter with FTDI Chipset
5. USB Plug Adaptor (for powering the Raspberry Pi)

It's important to note that one Meross WiFi Smart Plug powers both the Master Speaker and the Raspberry Pi (via the USB Power Adapter). This dual-powering is key to the automation process.

## Plugging Into the Future: The Smart Plug Strategy

I connected the Master speaker and the Raspberry Pi's power supply to one Meross WiFi Smart Plug, and the Slave speaker to another. These plugs are compatible with HomeKit, allowing me to control the power to the speakers from my Apple devices. In the HomeKit app, I grouped these two plugs together under "Speakers," making it easy to turn both speakers on or off simultaneously.

## Wiring for Wonder: The Physical Connections Explained

The Raspberry Pi connects to the Master speaker via the RS232 adapter. This allows the Pi to send commands directly to the speaker. The Master and Slave speakers are connected via a Comms cable, which allows the Master to control the Slave.

## The Brain of the Operation: Configuring the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi acts as a bridge between the smart home ecosystem and the RS232 interface of the Meridian speakers. Here's how I set it up:

1. Operating System: I installed DietPi, a lightweight Debian-based OS, to ensure fast boot times
2. Boot Script (activate.sh):
   I created a script called activate.sh with the following content:
   ```bash
   # Insert your activate.sh script here
